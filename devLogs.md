Nnaemeka 02/28/24: Initial commits, nothing else but setters and getters

K 2-29-24: Started the controller for the Users class. I think we'll need seperate operations for each of the user parameters so it'll probably end up being a pretty long doc but I'll try to meet with Johnson before we start. I'e started doing some research on how to make/import a database microservice (or do we have to make our own?). Feeling overwhelmed by options.

K 3-2-24: Made a constructor for user, started making some basic CRUD methods for user in its controller. Spent some busy time making a doc with a bucnh of sample user data we can test things with later. The search for how to use a database is going slow, definitely looking at mysql as an option.

Y 3/4/24: Created a concise README that describes the project, dependencies, technologies that will be used, and microservices we'll plan to implement.

Nnaemeka 3/4/24: Created a UserService and UserRepository. The user service is responsible for managing users. This includes creating, reading, updating, and deleting users. The repository will be used to interact with a database that contains user info.
Y 4/1/24: updated the read me with more details on external api and other resources we could use.
